Over the past 5 tutorials you've built up an impressive portfolio, well done!\n\n&TITLE>Pricing&W>\n\nTo maintain good profits its important to charge the right price. If you charge too much you might not sell all your stock, if you charge too little you might miss out on additional revenue.\n\nIt looks like we have a problem with our &eff1>Eases Migraine&W> product."},

This ranges from a value of S+ to F, with the average being C. The higher the rating (closer to S+) the more we can sell each day and the more we can charge.\n\nThe &LTBLUE>Sales Rating&W> is based on the &LTBLUE>Cure Rating&W>, which is the basic effectiveness of the product. By hovering over a product's &LTBLUE>Cure Rating&W> you can see how many people have been helped and how many &effbad>Side-Effects&W> have been caused.\n\nIn the next tutorial we'll take a more detailed look at how we can influence the &LTBLUE>Cure Rating&W> but that's not the only way to improve sales...\n\n&TITLE>Executives&W>\n\nExecutives allow you directly influence the &LTBLUE>Sales Rating&W> of your products."},

Redesign your existing &eff1>Treats Angina&W> production line so the final concentration is at its max strength concentration.\n\nHint: The final concentration should be 9!\n\nIf you need a helping hand take a look at the picture below."},
